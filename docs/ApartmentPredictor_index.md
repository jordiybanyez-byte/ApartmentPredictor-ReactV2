# ApartmentPredictor-React: project management

## Summary Product Goal

> The **ApartmentPredictor** application evolves through **sprints (seven incremental versions)**, building <mark>from a minimal proof-of-concept into a full-featured real-estate platform</mark> with modern UX, security, monetization, AI, and geospatial capabilities.

**Version 1** delivers a simple read-only apartments list: React frontend fetches data via **axios** + **useEffect** from a basic Spring Boot REST endpoint (`GET /api/apartments`), starting coupled then refactored to decoupled services/hooks.

**Version 2** expands the backend into a rich domain model with full **CRUD** for apartments and relations (Schools, Property Contracts, Reviews, Owners, Reviewers), while frontend gains detailed forms and relational views.

**Version 3** brings professional polish: **Material-UI** components, persistent **Drawer** navigation, and **React Context** for shared global state (apartments list, user profile, light/dark theme).

### To evaluate order

**Version 4** achieves production readiness with **AWS Cognito** authentication, JWT tokens, protected routes, and login/register pages.

**Version 5** introduces business value via **Stripe** payments: frontend checkout flows, backend session creation, payment intents, and webhooks to manage premium access.

**Version 6** layers intelligence: an **AI Predictor** page using Java ML libraries (Smile/Weka regression, Deeplearning4j/Tribuo neural nets) to forecast rent/sale prices via `/api/predict`.

**Version 7** finalizes visualization: **Leaflet** Map page with apartment/school markers and a detailed **Property/Contract** view.

This progression mirrors mature real-estate platforms — starting with listings, maturing through management, security, monetization, smart predictions, and spatial/contractual insights — creating a scalable, <mark>user-centric solution.</mark>

## Versions detail

Here is the original 8-version evolution table **split into two** focused parts for clearer reading and comparison — especially useful when zooming in on frontend/backend progression separately from cross-cutting concerns (state, security, monetization, AI, UI polish, and specialized pages).

### Table 1 – Core Implementation Progression
